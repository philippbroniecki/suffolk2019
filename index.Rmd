# About this course {-}

This course is an introduction to data science. We have three primary aims. First, to introduce you to the logic of quantitative research design. Second, to familiarise you with statistical models that scientists and policy-makers use to answer social science questions. Third, to help you acquire the necessary skills to conduct your own quantitative research projects. No prior statistical knowledge is assumed. We will use the statistical software R and RStudio on top.

My **office hours are Mondays from 4 pm to 6 pm in room 140**. You can drop-in in groups. There is no need to book in advance. Please make use of the office hours.
