## Seminar

In this session we introduce R-syntax, and data types.

### Functions

Functions are a set of instructions that carry out a specific task. Functions often require some input and generate some output. For example, instead of using the `+` operator for addition, we can use the `sum` function to add two or more numbers.

```{r}
sum(1, 4, 10)
```

In the example above, `1, 4, 10` are the inputs and `r sum(1, 4, 10)` is the output. A function always requires the use of parenthesis or round brackets `()`. Inputs to the function are called **arguments** and go inside the brackets. The output of a function is displayed on the screen but we can also have the option of saving the result of the output. More on this later.

### Getting Help

Another useful function in R is `help` which we can use to display online documentation. For example, if we wanted to know how to use the `sum` function, we could type `help(sum)` and look at the online documentation. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
help(sum)
```

The question mark `?` can also be used as a shortcut to access online help. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
?sum
```

Use the toolbar button shown in the picture above to expand and display the help in a new window.

Help pages for functions in R follow a consistent layout generally include these sections:

| | |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|Description |A brief description of the function|
|Usage        |The complete syntax or grammar including all arguments (inputs)|
|Arguments    |Explanation of each argument|
|Details      |Any relevant details about the function and its arguments|
|Value        |The output value of the function|
|Examples     |Example of how to use the function|

### The Assignment Operator 

Now we know how to provide inputs to a function using parenthesis or round brackets `()`, but what about the output of a function? 

We use the assignment operator **`<-`** for creating or updating objects. If we wanted to save the result of adding `sum(1, 4, 10)`, we would do the following:

```{r}
myresult <- sum(1, 4, 10)
```

The line above creates a new object called `myresult` in our environment and saves the result of the `sum(1, 4, 10)` in it. To see what's in `myresult`, just type it at the console:

```{r}
myresult
```

Take a look at the **Environment** pane in RStudio and you'll see `myresult` there.

To delete all objects from the environment, you can use the **broom** button as shown in the picture above.

We called our object `myresult` but we can call it anything as long as we follow a few simple rules. Object names can contain upper or lower case letters (`A-Z`, `a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), underscores (`_`) or a dot (`.`) but all object names must start with a letter. Choose names that are descriptive and easy to type.

|Good Object Names|Bad Object Names          |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
|result           |a                         |
|myresult         |x1                        |
|my.result        |this.name.is.just.too.long|
|my_result        |                          |
|data1            |                          |

### Vecors and subsetting

A vector is one dimensional. It can contain one element in which case it is also called a scalar or many elements. We can add and multiply vectors. Think of a vector as a row or column in your excel spreadsheet.

To create a vector, we use the `c()` function, where c stands for collect. We start by creating a numeric vector.

```{r}
vec1 <- c(10, 47, 99, 34, 21)
```

Creating a character vector works in the same way. We need to use quotation marks to indicate that the data type is textual data.

```{r}
vec2 <- c("Emilia", "Martin", "Agatha", "James", "Luke", "Jacques")
```

Let's see how many elements our vector contains using the `length()` function.

```{r}
length(vec1)
length(vec2)
```

We need one coordinate to identify a unique element in a vector. For instance, we may be interested in the first element of the vector only. We use square brackets `[]` to access a specific element. The number in square brackets is the vector element that we wish to see.

```{r}
vec1[1]
```

To access all elements except the first element, we use the `-` operator

```{r}
vec1[-1]
```

We can access elements 2 to 4 by using the colon `:` operator.

```{r}
vec1[2:4]
```

We can access non-adjacent elements bu using the collect function `c()`.

```{r}
vec1[c(2,5)]
```

Finally, we combine the `length()` function with the square brackets to access the last element in our vector.

```{r}
vec1[ length(vec1) ]
```

### Matrices

A matrix has two dimensions and stores data of the same type, e.g. numbers or text but never both. A matrix is always rectengular. Think of it as your excel spreadsheet - essentially, it is a data table.

We create a matrix using the `matrix()` function. We need to provide the follwing arguments:

```{r}
mat1 <- matrix(
  data = c(99, 17, 19, 49, 88, 54),
  nrow = 2,
  ncol = 3,
  byrow = TRUE
)
```

|Argument         |Description               |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
|data             |the data in the matrix    |
|nrow             |number of rows            |
|ncol             |number of columns         |
|byrow            |TRUE = matrix is filled rowwise|

To display the matrix, we simply call the object by its name (in this case mat1).

```{r}
mat1
```

To access a unique element in a matrix, we need 2 coordinates. First, a row coordinate and second, a column coordinate. We use square brackets and separate the coordinates with a comma `[ , ]`. The row coordinate goes before the comma and the column coordinate after.

We can access the the second row and third column like so:

```{r}
mat1[2, 3]
```

To display an entire column, we specify the column we want to display and leave the row coordinate empty like so:

```{r}
# display the 2nd column
mat1[ , 2]
```

Similarly, to diplay the entire second row, we specify the row coordinate but leave the column coordinate empty.

```{r}
mat1[2, ]
```

### Arrays

Arrays are similar to matrices but can contain more dimensions. You can think of an array as stacking multiple matrices. Generally, we refer to the rows, columns and layers in array. Let's create an array with 2 rows, 3 columns and 4 layers using the `array()` function.

```{r}
arr1 <- array(
  data = c(1:24),
  dim = c(2, 3, 4)
)
```

To display the object, we call it by its name.

```{r}
arr1
```

We can subset an array using the square brackets `[]`. To access a single element we need as many coordinates as our object has dimensions. Let's check the number of dimensions in our object first.

```{r}
dim(arr1)
```

The `dim()` function informs us that we have 3 dimensions. The first is of length 2, the second of length 3 and the fourth of length 4.

Access the second column of the third layer on your own.

```{r class.source="collapsible"}
arr1[ , 2, 3] 
```
