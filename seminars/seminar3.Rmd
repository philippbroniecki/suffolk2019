# Data import (from csv, txt, and excel)

## Seminar

In this section, we will load data in csv, txt, excel and R format. We will learn how to check and set our working directory.

### Setting up

We set our working directory. R operates in specific directory (folder) on our computer. We create a folder on where we save our scripts. We name the folder `suffolk2019`. Let's create the folder on our computers now (in finder on Mac and explorer on Windows).

Now, we set our working directory to the folder, we just created like so:

![](./img/setwdir.png)

Create a new R script and save it as day1.R to your `suffolk2019` directory. 

At the beginning of each new script, we want to clear the workspace. The workspace is stored in working memory on our computer. If we do not clear it for a new script, it becomes too full over time. Our computer will slow down and it will become difficult for us to know which objects are stored in working memory.

We check the contents of our workspace like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# check workspace
ls()
```

To remove a specific object, we use the `rm()` function which stands for remove. Within the round brackets, we put the name of the object we want to remove. We could remove the object `a` like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# delete variable 'a' from workspace
rm(a)
```

At the beginning of each script, we should always clear the entire workspace. We can do so in the following way:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# delete everything from workspace
rm( list = ls() )
```

You can also clear text from the console window. To do so press Crtl+l on Winowds or Command+l on Mac.


### Loading data

Data comes in different file formats such as `.txt`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.RData`, `.dta` and many more. To know the file type of a file right click on it and view preferences (in Windows explorer or Mac finder).

R can load files coming in many different file formats. To find out how to import a file coming in a specific format, it is usually a good idea to the google "R load file_format".

### Importing a dataset in `.csv` format

One of the most common file types is `.csv` which means comma separated values. Columns are separated by commas and rows by line breaks. 

The dataset's name is "non_western_immigrants.csv". To load it, we use the `read.csv()` function.

```{r}
dat1 <- read.csv("non_western_immigrants.csv")
```

### Importing a dataset in Excel (xlsx) format

Another common file format is Microsoft's Excel `xlsx` format. We will load a dataset in this format now. To do so, we will need to install a package first. Packages are additional functions that we can add to R. A package is like an app on our phones. 

We install the `readxl` package using `install.packages("readxl")`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readxl")
```

We only need to install a package once. It does not hurt to do it more often though, because every time we install, it will install the most recent version of the package.

Once a package is installed, we need to load it using the `library()` function. 

```{r}
library(readxl)
```

To load the excel file, we can now use the `read_excel()` function that is included in the `readxl` library. We need to provide the following arguments to the function:

|Argument         |Description               |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
|path             |Filename of excel sheet   |
|sheet            |Sheet number to import    |

Now, let's load the file:

```{r}
dat2 <- read_excel("non_western_immigrants.xlsx", sheet = 1)
```

### Importing a dataset in RData format

The native file format of R is called `.RData`. To load files saved in this format, we use the `load()` function like so:

```{r}
load(file = "non_western_immigrants.RData")
```

Notice that we usually need to assign the object we load to using the `<-` operator. The `load()` function is an exception where we do not need to do this.


### Importing a dataset in .txt format.

Loading a dataset that comes in .txt format requires some additional information. The format is a text format and we need to know how the columns are separated. Usually it is enough to open the file in a word processor such as notepad to see how this is done. The most common ways to separate columns is by using commas or tabs but other separators such as for instance semicolons are sometimes also used.

In our example, columns are separated by semicolons. We use the `read.table()` function and provide the following arguments:

|Argument         |Description               |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
|file             |Filename of excel sheet   |
|sep              |the symbol that separates columns    |
|header           |whether the first row contains variable names or not    |


```{r}
dat3 <- read.table(file = "non_western_immigrants.txt", sep =";", header = TRUE)
```
